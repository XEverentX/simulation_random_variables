# Simulation of random variables
Laboratory work for Theory of probability. Simulation of random variables by given distribution density.

### Build & Run
To build application simply follow a few steps:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config RELEASE
```

There is two task's able to run. Use `simulation` as `<excecutable>` to run.

To run under `linux` use:

./samples/<executable>
```

To run under `windows` use:

```bash
.\samples\Release\<executable>.exe
```
